        "story": "For you, they protect you from rain. For us, they protect us from the brutality of the Hong Kong Police. They symbolized our firm stance against China’s mounting pressure on our freedom of speech.\n\nIn 2014, during a demonstration for the right to vote in Hong Kong, plenty of peaceful protestors carried an umbrella out of habit as it was during the rainy season of our city. They didn’t expect that their umbrellas would be used to shield against pepper sprays and 87 rounds of tear gas. Since then, umbrella has been a symbol of our determination against Chinese oppression."

        "story": "Despite a series of demonstrations in June, Carrie Lam refused to withdraw the Extradition Bill. Instead, she accused the protestors of being “brutal” and described them as “savages”.\n\nOn 1st of July 2019, the 22nd anniversary of Chinese takeover of Hong Kong, fifty-five thousand Hong Kongers marched in the streets once again. At night, a group of protestors stormed the Legislative Council, erecting slogans and spraying demands for freedom and justice all over the conference room. At the center of the chamber stood our answer to Carrie Lam’s accusation: ”There are no savage protestors, only savage government”"

        "story": "In response to the 9th June Protest, on 15th June Carrie Lam announced a pause on enacting the Extradition Bill. Hong Kongers feared that this is only a delay tactic, leading to another protest on the following day. This is the protest. At its peak 2 million Hong Kongers, almost one-third of our population, were marching in the streets. Major thoroughfares in Central were all flooded with demonstrators. For the second time in June, our nightscape was lit by its citizens."

        "story": "This is the Chinese Social Credit system to be implemented in 2020. By then, everything we do will change our “Social Score”. Imagine when you are living under such a system. If you help elderlies in need, your score will move up. On the other hand, if you mistreat old people your score will drop. As expected, if you “disturbed or assault properties of the party” your Social Score dwindles. Will our Social Score plummet if we continue to defend our dwindling freedom as we are now doing? What happens if our scores are too low? No one knows."
